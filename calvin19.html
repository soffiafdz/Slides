            <li>
              Assess whether any associations between baseline cognitive

            </li>
            <li>
              and, whether cognitive scores add anything to prediction
              models of the disease.

            <li>Low-to-moderate test-retest reliability of cognitive tests</li>
            <li>Missing data from participants with lower cognitive ability and/or
              poorer health were likely to have reduced sensitivity due to selective attrition</li>

          <h2>Main conclusions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Even a brief cognitive test battery has predictive power at the population level</li>
            <li>AD was defined by a relatively stronger association with APOE4 and VaD
              risk by slower processing speed and greater vascular risk factors</li>
            <li>None of the modifiable risk factors but depression increased risk for AD; several did for VaD</li>
            <li>Modifiable risk factors had almost no impact on the performance of the prediction models that included cognitive and genetic factors</li>
